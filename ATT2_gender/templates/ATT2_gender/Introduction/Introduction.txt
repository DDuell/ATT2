Instructions
</strong>
<p>
In this interaction, at the beginning of the first round, you will be randomly
assigned a role of either <i> Player 1</i> or <i> Player 2</i>. You will keep that
role for the rest of the interaction. In each round, you will be matched
with another participant in the study into a pair consisting of one
<i>Player 1</i> and one <i>Player 2</i>.

</p>

<p>
In each round, if you are <i> Player 1 </i> you will be randomly assigned
a number 1, 2, or 3 – called <i> special number </i> – shown only to you
and where each of these <i> special numbers </i> is equally likely to be
assigned by the computer.
</p>

<p>
<b> Choices </b>
</p>

<p>
If you are <i>Player 1</i> you choose a number 1, 2, or 3 – called
<i>effort</i>. 
</p>

<p>
Then, 
</p>
<p align="center">
<i>outcome = effort + special number + random bump</i>
</p>

<p>
is computed where <i>random bump</i> is a randomly chosen number -1, 0, or 1
and every of those numbers is equally likely to occur.
</p>

<p>
If you are <i>Player 2</i> you make two choices after you are shown
the <i>outcome</i>:<br>
1. you are asked whether you think <i>effort is higher</i> or
<i>special number is higher</i><br>
2. you chose whether you want
to give a <i>bonus</i> (another additional payment) to <i>Player 1</i>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Additional payments</b>
</p>

{% if num_rounds > 1 %}
<p>
You additional payment is determined from what happened in 1 randomly 
chosen round of the {{ num_rounds }} you played.
</p>
{% endif %}

<p>
If you are <i>Player 1</i>, your additional payments are increasing in
the <i>outcome</i> you generate and in whether <i>Player 2</i> gives you a
<i>bonus</i>. What these payments are exactly, is shown to you on
the screen once you actually make that choice.
</p>

<p>
If you are <i>Player 2</i>, your additional payments from the game is
computed as
</p>

<p align="center">
<i>outcome +
    (effort is higher)*(effort) + (special number is higher)*(special number)</i>
</p>

<p>
That means, when <i>Player 1</i> chose an <i>effort</i> that is higher 
than <i>Player 1’s</i> special number, and you chose '<i>effort</i> is higher,'
then you receive a higher payoff than when you chose
'<i>special number</i> is higher.' When <i>special number</i> is higher 
than <i>effort</i>, and you chose '<i>special number</i> is higher,'
then you receive a higher payoff than when you chose '<i>effort</i> is
higher.'
</p>

<p>
Example: Say <i>Player 1</i> is assigned a <i>special number</i> of 2,
<i>Player 1</i> chooses <i>effort</i> of 1, the <i>random bump</i> is 0, and you
think <i>special number</i> is higher. Your additional payment would
be
</p>

<p align="center">

2 + 1 + 0 + 2 = $5 

</p>

<p>
If you think <i>effort</i> is higher, your additional payment would be
</p>

<p align="center">
2 + 1 + 0 + 1 = $4
</p>
