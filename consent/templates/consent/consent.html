You have been invited to take part in a study by researchers at the University of Essex
Department of Government to learn more about group decision making. If you agree to be in this study, 
you will answer a few questions and then interact with other participants in a short game. 
Your participation in the study may last up to 15 minutes and you may have to wait for up to 
5 minutes until enough participants have joined this interactive study. There are no known 
risks associated with this research beyond those of everyday life. Although you will receive 
no direct benefits, this research may help us better understand how individuals think.
<br>
<br>

You will receive a reward of $1 and additional bonus between $1 and $5 depending on yours and 
other participantsâ€™ choices. You may refuse to participate or withdraw at any time. 
However, if you withdraw before the end of the study, you will receive no payment.

The confidentiality of your research records and identity will be strictly maintained. To preserve 
the anonymity of the data, each person is assigned a random code number that will be used to keep 
track of data produced. Results of the study in any presentation or publication will 
include only group results, and no identifying information will ever be used.
